# ~/dÃµtfá¸­láº½s ðŸ™„

This is my opinionated setup for dotfiles and their organization.

## Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:egid/dotfiles.git` to wherever you'd like. Fork it if you want. 
2. I'll assume you cloned to `~/dotfiles`.
3. `brew install stow` (if Homebrew isn't installed yet, do that)
4. `cd ~/dotfiles && ./scripts/init.sh`
